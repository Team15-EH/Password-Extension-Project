				<h4>There are a variety of ways to make your password more secure.</h3>
				<p>One practice heralded by the National Cyber Security Centre is
				to find three random words from a dictionary and combine them to
				create a long string of random characters. This approach is appropriately titled
				the "Three Random Words" approach.</p>
				<p>This approach aims to make it more difficult to break password's via
				brute force by both increasing their length and avoiding the useage of 
				single word passwords which can be easily cracked by Dictionary attacks. 
				Additionally this approach takes human memory into account by making
				passwords easier to remember than simply a random combination of 
				characters.</p>

			<div id="generalTips">
				<h4>Here are some general tips to increase your password's security.</h3>
					<p>>It is extremely dangerous to use easily accessible information about yourself.</p>
					<p>>The longer your password the better as this will make it more difficult for brute force attacks to be successful</p>
					<p>>Use a variety of numbers and special characters to stop basic wordlists.</p>
					<p>>Each of these tips can be used in conunction with the three random words approach to create a secure password.</p>
